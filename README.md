# Custom FFmpeg RPM build

This repository contains a custom RPM build that doesn't require RPMFusion packages.

It also contains bug fixes that are not available upstream.

## Bug fixes

* A patch for [#8522](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/8522) - fixes MPEG-DASH segment number calculation for certain edge cases

## Releases

Releases are built by a GitHub action that triggers on tag creation.

Each commit or pull request starts a test build that can be used to verify the resulting package.
The build artifacts can be found under the Actions job corresponding to the commit. 

Once you are satisfied, create a tag for the full package version (e.g. `5.1.2-1`), and another workflow will
automatically launch a release build and create a GitHub release with the built packages.
